# Project-Kelvin
Project Kelvin is a DAO framework for Impact-Driven DAOs.

We combine a sybil-resistant "subjective metric" that can measure values like integrity or playfulness, with a sybil-resistant objective metric that can measure goals like "Lives Saved" or "Customers Served", into a single "Impact Score". 

We then allow DAOs to work together using a "recursive bonding curve" model that allows tokens to flow to the people and projects who have the most positive impact.
